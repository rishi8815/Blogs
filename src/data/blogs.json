    "introduction": "Getting your first job can be both exciting and stressful. As a fresher, it’s easy to make small mistakes that have big consequences. Many students and recent graduates unknowingly fall into traps that delay their hiring journey. In this blog, we'll walk through the top 10 mistakes freshers make while applying for jobs — and, more importantly, how to fix them. Whether you're applying through platforms like LinkedIn, job boards, or smart portals like GetNaukri, avoiding these common pitfalls will improve your chances of getting hired.",
    "sections": [
      {
        "heading": "1. Using the Same Resume for Every Job",
        "mistake": "Freshers often send a one-size-fits-all resume for every application.",
        "fix": "Customize your resume for each job role. Use keywords from the job description, focus on relevant skills, and match the tone of the company. Personalization makes your application stand out."
      },
      {
        "heading": "2. Spelling Errors & Poor Formatting",
        "mistake": "Grammar mistakes, inconsistent fonts, and cluttered layouts create a bad impression.",

        "mistake": "Freshers often believe only multinational companies (MNCs) matter.",

        "mistake": "Listing only education without showcasing practical skills or real work experience.",

        "mistake": "A half-filled LinkedIn or GetNaukri profile reduces your visibility to recruiters.",

        "mistake": "Applying and waiting endlessly without checking back.",

        "mistake": "Applying only for full-time roles without having prior experience.",

      "content": "Imagine walking into an interview, your heart pounding, palms slightly sweaty. Before you even say much, the interviewer has already formed an opinion about you. Sounds intense, right? First impressions are crucial, especially in job interviews. Research suggests hiring managers form snap judgments within the first 30 seconds to 5 minutes.\n\nEverything that follows — your qualifications, answers, and experience — is filtered through that initial perception. So, how can you ensure a powerful, positive, and lasting first impression? This guide will help you master the psychology, body language, and communication skills necessary to ace the first five minutes of your interview."

      "heading": "The Science Behind First Impressions",
      "content": "**Thin-Slicing: Judging in Seconds**  \nOur brains make instant judgments based on limited information, a phenomenon known as thin-slicing.\n\n**Example:** Candidate A walks in confidently, smiles, and greets warmly. Candidate B avoids eye contact, slouches, and mumbles a greeting. Before either speaks, the interviewer already perceives one as more confident and professional.\n\n**The Halo Effect: One Good Trait Changes Everything**  \nA strong first impression can influence how the interviewer perceives the rest of your performance.\n\n**Example:** If you greet them with a firm handshake and engaging small talk, they are more likely to overlook minor mistakes later.\n\n**Confirmation Bias: Reinforcing First Impressions**  \nOnce an interviewer forms an opinion, they subconsciously look for evidence to support it. If you start strong, they'll view your qualifications more favorably. If you start weak, you'll need to work harder to shift their perception."
